<p>I am working on the next Ext-GWT blog, but in the interim, I would like to share an awesome podcast that I found at <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Scott Hanselman's</a> blog. He interviews Robert C. Martin (author of a few excellent agile, code cleanup, and object oriented design books) who dives into great explanations of the "SOLID" (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substiution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) Principles of which every object-oriented developer should be aware! <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=163">Listen to the podcast</a> at Scott's blog.</p>
