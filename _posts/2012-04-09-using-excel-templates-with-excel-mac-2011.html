<p>I use a Mac for all of my development (where I can), but one thing I had to do recently was use Excel on a Mac and create a new spreadsheet from a template. To my surprise and frustration, I could find no reliable documentation online. I figured it out.<!--more-->Here's what I did (and if anyone has a link to where it was on Google or the MS website, please share with me. I wasted time and my own frustration trying to find the correct solution, but was instead pointed to many directions that ended up being absolutely wrong): I created a new template in Excel and saved it. Then I checked the properties for that file and where it was located on the disk. I ended up with this location for templates:<br />
&gt; /Users//Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates</p>
