<p>I'm excited to be giving a webinar on Wednesday (December 18th, 2013) at 9am MST (so that translates to 8am PST, 11 EST, and 16:00 UTC). I've already heard that the signups for this event are off the charts, so thanks to everyone who plans to join.</p>
<p>If you haven't signed up yet, <a href="https://t.co/mfYDtPEcVz">go sign up right now!!</a>. It's December, most places have code freezes, and you're gonna be board anyway. Might as well <a href="https://t.co/mfYDtPEcVz">make good use of the time :)</a>.</p>
<p>The webinar I'll be giving will be about Apache Camel, middleware, and how to simplify enterprise integrations.</p>
<p><a href="http://camel.apache.org">Apache Camel</a> is the de-facto standard "integration library". Even so, I still often get asked "What is Apache Camel" and "why would I use it?"</p>
<p>The short answer comes down to this: Are you trying to get two systems (or more!) to talk to each other in order to help support a business service or business process? Or, are you trying to intelligently route, aggregate, or transform data/messages from producers to consumers? And lastly, do your integration points speak different protocols, transports, or languages?</p>
<p>Then <em>yes</em>, Apache Camel is for you.</p>
<p>The webinar will container a slightly longer answer with some more color, defined concepts, step throughs, and a live demo!</p>
