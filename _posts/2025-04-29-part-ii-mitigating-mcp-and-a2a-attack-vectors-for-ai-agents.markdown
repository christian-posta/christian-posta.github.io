## Mitigations

### Potential Mitigations for Naming Attacks

To address these vulnerabilities, we should consider:

1. **Strict Registration Policies**: Implementing formal registration systems with verification processes

2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Requiring agent and server identities to be cryptographically signed by trusted authorities.

3. **Reputation Systems**: Developing trust scores for agents and servers based on usage patterns and community feedback.

4. **Fuzzy Name Matching Detection**: Adding warnings when names are suspiciously similar to established services.

5. **Centralized Catalog Services**: Creating verified catalogs of legitimate agents with strong identity verification


### Mitigations for Context Poisoning / Indirection Prompt Injection

Tracing to avoid sleeper cell scenarios

Addressing these sophisticated attacks requires layered defenses:

1. **Service Mesh Security**: Implementing robust authentication and authorization between agents using technologies like SPIFFE for identity verification.

2. **Context Sanitization**: Developing filters to detect and neutralize potential injection attempts.

3. **Least Privilege Principles**: Ensuring agents only receive the minimum context needed for their specific tasks.

4. **Behavior Monitoring**: Tracking patterns of agent interactions to detect unusual flow of information.

5. **Input Validation**: Implementing strict validation of all inputs passed between agents.

6. **Cryptographic Attestation**: Requiring verifiable proof of message integrity throughout agent chains.

### Mitigations Shadowing Attacks

### Mitigating  Rug Pull Threat

Defending against these sophisticated attacks requires a multi-layered approach. First and foremost, implement strict version pinning and content hashing for both MCP tools and A2A agents. This creates immutability guarantees that prevent silent updates without explicit approval.

A gradual trust escalation model can also provide significant protection. New tools and agents should initially receive limited access to sensitive contexts, with privileges expanding only as they establish consistent reliability over time. Even then, critical systems should employ anomaly detection to monitor for unexpected changes in behavior or output patterns.

For mission-critical workflows, formal verification offers another layer of defense. By verifying outputs against known-good results or invariant conditions, organizations can catch manipulations before they cause damage. Finally, canary deployments that test updates on isolated instances can identify malicious changes before they reach production environments.

The rug pull represents a particularly insidious threat because it exploits the very trust that makes AI agent ecosystems valuable. By recognizing this vector and implementing appropriate safeguards, we can build agent networks that maintain their dynamic capabilities while resisting these attacks.
