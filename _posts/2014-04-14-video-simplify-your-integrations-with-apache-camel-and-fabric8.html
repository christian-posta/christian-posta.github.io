<p>I just finished my talk at <a href="http://www.devnation.org">DevNation</a> on Simplifying your integrations with Apache Camel. You can find the slides here:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ceposta/simplify-integrationsfinalpdf" title="Simplify integrations-final-pdf" target="_blank">Simplify integrations-final-pdf</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ceposta" target="_blank">ceposta</a></strong> </div>
<p>It went great, and if you're (or were) at the DevNation conference you probably got to see a lot of the new awesomeness from the <a href="http://fabric8.io">Fabric8</a> team.</p>
<p>If you didn't make it to the conference, or missed my talk, well you're in luck; I've webcasted my slides as well as my demo.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with Camel, maybe you can just skip the slides and take a look at my demo.</p>
<h2>Awesome Demo!</h2>
<p>The demo is really cool and shows how to go from scratch (nothing) to a fully deployed project on Fuse with fault-tolerant/highly-available messaging, scalability, flexibility, and logging/debugging/tracing. It's really pretty fantastic technology (components made up from <a href="http://camel.apache.org">Camel</a>, [ActiveMQ][activemq], <a href="http://hawt.io">HawtIO</a> and <a href="http://fabric8.io">Fabric8</a>), and I highly recommend you take a look at the video (~35min) and download <a href="https://www.jboss.org/products/fuse.html">JBoss Fuse</a> and try it out.</p>
