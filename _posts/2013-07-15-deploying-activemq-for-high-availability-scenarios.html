<p>JBoss A-MQ  is based on Apache <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">ActiveMQ</a>. It's lightweight, has excellent performance, and can be configured to fit a variety of use cases.</p>
<p>One of those use cases, and a requirement that you'll find in most enterprises, is being able to have a messaging backbone that can withstand unplanned faults, planned outages, and other disaster scenarios. <a href="http://scottcranton.blogspot.com">Scott Cranton</a> and Jack Britton <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/events-webinars/webinars/2013-07-16-deploy-jboss-amq-high-availability">will be giving a webinar tomorrow</a> on how to deploy and configure JBoss A-MQ to be highly available (HA) and give lots of good tips and tricks for complex scenarios, cloud deployments, and using Fuse Fabric.</p>
<p>The top companies in banking, e-commerce, retail, and health care, and others all use ActiveMQ and/or JBoss A-MQ.
