<p>So I was planning to give a talk on ActiveMQ at the Phoenix JUG this August, but through no fault of my own, it has been rescheduled for September. Well... actually, I didn't plan and coordinate it properly and got bumped... so kinda my fault.. but never fear, you can regroup and re-plan to join me the evening of September 11th for next month's PHXJUG presentation.</p>
<p>Here is the abstract for my talk:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apache ActiveMQ is the most widely used message-oriented middleware that uses messaging to connect remote applications written in Java,C,C++, Python,Perl, Ruby and many more. ActiveMQ is standards-based and supports messaging protocols such as AMQP 1.0, WebSockets, Stomp, OpenWire and MQTT.</p>
<p>Come find out about the latest upcoming Apache release, 5.9.0, and some of its new features including HawtIO, LevelDB, HA replication, and others.</p>
<p>Additionally, Apache Apollo is the "next-generation" of ActiveMQ built on a non-blocking/async core to scale out for future requirements &gt;including higher numbers of connections, destinations, and faster messaging. I'll present what it is, what makes it tick, and its future.</p></blockquote>
<p>See you there! And plan on beer afterwards...</p>
