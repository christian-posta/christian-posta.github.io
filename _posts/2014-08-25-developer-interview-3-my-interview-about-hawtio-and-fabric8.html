<p>Recently, in between waking up to help my wife with our ten-day old baby at wee hours of the day, I had a chance to be part of <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2014/08/developer-interviews-di-3-christian.html">Markus Eisele's Developer Interview series</a>. I chatted casually about my experiences, OpenSource, and showed a quick demo of HawtIO and Fabric8 (more talked about it... but think of our demo as one of my blog posts in "podcast" form).</p>
<p>The developer series <a href="http://blog.eisele.net">Markus</a> is working is excellent. Small 20 min [though mine went a little over ;) ] interviews with developers to catch up on some of the new exciting projects they're working on. Great for a Monday-morning kickstart (with lots of coffee?) or a quick video for your lunch break.</p>
<p>Either way, check it out, check out <a href="http://blog.eisele.net">Markus's blog for the rest of the series</a>, including the first two from <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2014/08/developer-interview-with-me-about.html">Claus Ibsen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ehsavoie">Emmanuel Hugonnet</a></p>
