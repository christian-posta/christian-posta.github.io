I'm looking forward to speaking at [DevNation 2015](http://www.devnation.org) and [Red Hat Summit 2015](http://www.redhat.com/summit/) next week in Boston, as well as meeting some of you in person! If you'll be going and wish to meet up, tweet me [@christianposta](https://twitter.com/christianposta). There's plenty of beer to be shared :)

I'm pretty excited to share some of the things that the [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io) community has been doing around Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift v3, and Microservices. If you couldn't make the [Microservices Architecture Day in London](http://www.redhatonline.com/uk/seminar/microservices-architecture-developer-day/) last week, there have [been some good writeups](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/06/redhat-microservices-london) about the event, including from a colleague of mine, [Claus Ibsen](http://www.davsclaus.com/2015/06/returning-from-microservices-event-in.html) who also did a presentation on Camel and Microservices.  

My presentations (below) will have a similar flavor to some of those presented in London, however -- note -- nobody can re-enact [James Strachan](https://medium.com/@jstrachan)'s ability to wow a crowd -- no matter how interesting the technology -- but nevertheless, here's what I'm going to be speaking about:


## CI/CD with Camel, Fabric8, and OpenShift 

`when:` Tuesday, June 23rd @ 2:45p Room 206 
`co presenter:` [Charles Moulliard](http://cmoulliard.github.io)

Come see how a practical, out-of-box-reusable deployment of a continuous delivery tool delivers complex integration deployments using tools like Docker, Jenkins, OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat, and Fabric8 V2.

As we in the Fabric8 community have worked with clients to complete complex integrations with JBoss Fuse, we’ve learned best practices doing continuous delivery. We’ve taken what we’ve learned and contributed to the Fabric8 community for an out of the box CI/CD environment built on Docker. 

In this session, we'll use this example to discuss continuous delivery, DevOps, and how Red Hat’s technology brings a practical approach to making the theory a reality

## Why real integration developers ride Camels
`when:` Wednesday, June 24th @ 1:20p Room 207
`co presenter:` [Kenny Peeples](http://www.ossmentor.com)

Apache Camel is a very powerful integration framework, and is the foundation of popular open-source integration platforms like JBoss Fuse. However, sometimes people gravitate toward proprietary competitor products with a misunderstanding about what Fuse and Camel can do and cannot do.

The open community, analyst think tanks, and our customers show time and time again that Camels are better for integration. In this talk, we'll focus on some of the areas that competitors feel are weaknesses, and address why Camel and Fuse are far better choices for integrating your applications, systems, and micro services, on premise, in virtualized environments, or in the cloud.


## Integrating microservices with Apache Camel and Fabric8
`when:` Wednesday, June 24th @ 2:30p Room 206

Microservices architectures are incredibly popular these days, but we have to balance hype with reality. Microservices make it harder to manage your deployments and create complex inter-service communications patterns. How do you balance the trade-offs and focus on getting the most out of your investment in highly scalable, decoupled systems?

Join this session to learn how to use service-oriented architecture patterns to build out intelligent routing systems with Apache Camel. We’ll show you how to use the foundations of OpenShift v3, including Kubernetes and Docker, to build highly scalable systems using a microservices approach.
