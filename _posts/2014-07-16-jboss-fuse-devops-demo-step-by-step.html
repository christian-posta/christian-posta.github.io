<p>I recently did a step-by-step demo on using <a href="http://fabric8.io">Fabric8</a> or <a href="http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/">JBoss Fuse</a> with an emphasis on DevOps. For those of you who aren't familiar with <a href="http://fabric8.io">Fabric8</a>, check out the overview I <a href="http://www.christianposta.com/blog/?p=376">put together a few weeks ago</a> and <a href="http://fabric8.io/gitbook/index.html">check out the community docs</a> as they freakin rock!</p>
<p>But for the step by step demo, have a look at the project source and the write up + screenshots at my github:</p>

<p>If you have some thoughts about what you want to see in the demo, drop me a line (twitter's best, @christianposta) and I'll try to get it in. Also, feel free to submit <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Pull Requests</a>!</p>
