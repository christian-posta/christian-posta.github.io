Do you use API keys to protect your enterprise APIs? If you work in a large enterprise organization, you probably do. This is a very common pattern. A developer can get access to an API for the application that they're writing by requesting (tickets, self-service portal, etc) an API key. They [then are responsible for keeping this key safe](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys-best-practices). The key gives the caller (their application) access to the API. 

As you adopt AI agents, LLMs, and MCP servers, you may think using API keys for communicating to LLMs, AI agents, or MCP services is a good idea. It's a terrible idea. If you take anything away from this blog:

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; border-right: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-top: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffeaa7; padding: 1em 1.5em; margin: 1.5em 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">
‚ö†Ô∏è API keys should not be used for security within an enterprise for <strong>LLM, AI agent, MCP tools, etc</strong> including for hosted LLM calls. API keys should be avoided altogether. There are better, more secure alternatives.

## How are API Keys Used

The way API keys are used in enterprise applications/environments is as long-lived, rarely rotated, service-to-service credentials. If an API key gives access to APIs and services, anyone/anything that possesses them can access those systems and services. There is nothing cryptographic about them, and there is no way to prove the user of the key is the intended user of the key. They are like real "keys". If you have a key, you can unlock something. 

Another fact about how API keys are used in enterprise environments is these keys are used to permit "coarse grained" access. That is, you either have access to something or you don't. Like a lock to the front door of a house. Once you're in, you have access to everything behind the door. More sophisticated implementations try to map API keys to "roles" where a role has some limited static permissions to a pre-defined group of resources.

The problem is, [API keys were NOT DESIGNED for security purposes](https://nordicapis.com/why-api-keys-are-not-enough/). Their intended purpose is like a "label" on HTTP requests that can be used for analytics, observability, quota/rate limiting, etc. Unfortunately, enterprises use them as security credentials. This blog from the folks at SPIRL/Defakto Security calls these types of [credentials "toxic", and they are right](https://www.defakto.security/blog/from-oauth-tokens-to-api-keys-the-toxic-data-behind-the-salesloft-drift-salesforce-breach/). If you ARE using API keys internally within your enterprise for security, you are definitely doing it wrong. 

## Why should API keys not be used for AI?

API keys present unique dangers in AI agent environments because AI is probabilistic. Agent decisions, dependencies, and call flows are emergent. API keys only prove possession, not legitimacy or appropriate use rights. In other words, if an agent possesses the key, how would the target API/Agent/Service know this is a legitimate use? How would the enterprise know whether any communication as a result of this is legitimate? Is the agent allowed to hold that API key? The called service/agent just sees someone with a key show up asking to do something that the key unlocks. 

For AI agents in the enterprise, this is particularly problematic especially for compliance. API keys grant "long standing, coarse grained privilege", that is, persistent access that remains active regardless of changing context or need. The autonomous nature of AI agents amplifies these risks. **Any permission granted via API key becomes "live and active"**: the agent will *eventually find a reason to use it*. Let's look at a simple example. 

### Example of AI Agent with API Keys

Developers at an enterprise built an HR Service Desk Agent. It is intended to help employees with the following:

* Answer questions about company policies and benefits
* Help you find and complete HR forms
* Check your PTO balance and help request time off
* Create tickets for HR requests


To perform these actions, the Agent needs access to the HR management system, document management system, ticketing system and of course an LLM. So the developers get an API key to the Oracle HCM system, one to the OpenText Content Server, and another to the Service Now system. 

These API keys have the following permissions:

| System / API | Role | Key Permissions |
|---------------|------|-----------------|
| **Oracle HCM** | Integration Specialist | ‚Ä¢ Read employee personal info<br>‚Ä¢ View compensation data<br>‚Ä¢ Retrieve org structures<br>‚Ä¢ View benefit enrollments |
| **OpenText Content Server** | Integration User | ‚Ä¢ See (Level 1)<br>‚Ä¢ See Contents (Level 2)<br>‚Ä¢ Read (Level 3)<br>‚Ä¢ Add (Level 4)<br>‚Ä¢ Delete (Level 5) |
| **ServiceNow ITSM** | Integration User | ‚Ä¢ Create, read, update incidents<br>‚Ä¢ Assign to self/others<br>‚Ä¢ Categorize/prioritize<br>‚Ä¢ Resolve/close incidents |


Typical requests to this HR agent look like this:

<h3>Typical Requests to the HR Agent</h3>

  <strong>üßë‚Äçüíº Employee request:</strong> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our company‚Äôs work from home policy?‚Äù<br>
  <strong>ü§ñ Agent action:</strong> Uses the <em>Document Management System</em> API key to retrieve the current WFH policy document from the HR policies folder.

  <strong>üßë‚Äçüíº Employee request:</strong> ‚ÄúI need to update my home address.‚Äù<br>
  <strong>ü§ñ Agent action:</strong> Uses the <em>Ticketing System</em> API key to create a ticket for the address change and the <em>Document Management System</em> API key to retrieve the appropriate form.

  <strong>ü§ñ Agent action:</strong> Uses the <em>HR Management System</em> API key to query only that specific employee‚Äôs time-off balance.
</div>

But, there may also be questions to the agent that the company would want to restrict or apply more fine-grained policy / dynamic access:

  <strong>ü§ñ Agent action:</strong> Uses the <em>HR Management System</em> API key to query salary data across the entire department or company, accessing compensation information for multiple employees.<br>
  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Why it‚Äôs problematic:</strong> The HR Service Account API key has blanket read permissions to all compensation data, allowing the agent to retrieve and analyze sensitive salary information that would normally require manager-level access.

  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Why it‚Äôs problematic:</strong> The combination of broad access across systems allows the agent to piece together sensitive information from multiple sources without proper authorization checks.
</div>



![](/images/api-keys/wide-access.png)


In each problematic scenario, the API key's static, broad permissions allow the AI agent to access information that should be restricted based on context. The systems receiving these API requests have no visibility into:

* Which specific employee is making the request
* Whether that employee should have access to that information
* The specific intent or purpose behind the query

This happens because the API keys authenticate the service (the AI assistant) rather than the actual user, creating a fundamental security disconnect. The systems only see requests coming from trusted service accounts with broad permissions, not the specific context of individual user requests.

<div style="background-color: #e7f5ff; border-left: 4px solid #1c7ed6; border-right: 1px solid #d0ebff; border-top: 1px solid #d0ebff; border-bottom: 1px solid #d0ebff; padding: 1em 1.5em; margin: 1.5em 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.6;">
üí° <strong>Key Insight:</strong> You could just say ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs just it, the main problem is these keys shouldn‚Äôt be so broad.‚Äù  
And you can say that all you want ‚Äî role-based access and API key security are commonplace in enterprise organizations.  
The main point of this blog is that we should <strong>not just continue the same practices we‚Äôve been doing all along for LLMs, AI agents, and MCP tools/APIs.</strong>
</div>


### What About for LLMs that Use API keys?

What about for LLMs? Hosted LLM providers almost all use API keys to give access. Again, this is typically broad ranging access to multiple models and services. Enterprises need much more fine grained policy control for compliance, data leakage, privacy, and audit requirements, for example:

* **Model-specific permissions**: Different LLMs have varying capabilities and risk profiles - enterprises need to restrict which specific models (GPT-5, Claude 4, etc.) each user/department/agent/tool can access
* **Context-aware authorization**: Access decisions must consider the user's context, the specific prompt content, and intended use case - not just a static API key
* **Token/usage quotas**: Fine-grained policies allow setting different usage limits per department, project, or use case to prevent cost overruns
* **Data classification boundaries**: Policies must enforce which classification levels of enterprise data can be used with which LLMs (e.g., confidential data might be restricted to private LLM deployments only)
* **Delegated agent permissions**: When AI agents act on behalf of users, policies must define exactly what LLM capabilities they can access and under what conditions

## What Alternatives Should we Pursue?

Enterprises deploying AI agents/chat bots and consuming hosted LLMs should **strive** for the following security posture:

1. **Ephemeral, Just-in-Time Identity**: Generate short-lived cryptographic identities for every connection that automatically expires and can be automatically renewed
2. **Continuous Verification**: Verify the legitimacy of each request rather than relying on a token that grants persistent access
3. **Contextual Access Control**: Adapt permissions based on runtime context, identtiy, agent intent, and risk levels

![](/images/api-keys/good.png)

In my opinion these are some of the most promising approaches:

### Mutual TLS (mTLS) with SPIFFE/SPIRE/Ambient Mesh
Instead of using API keys or traditional long-lived authentication tokens, [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io) (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone) assigns each service a cryptographic identity that uniquely identifies workloads in a zero-trust architecture. This can be used for LLM clients/chat bots/AI agents on both the caller and potentially the target side. If the target is a hosted/external service, we have other options (see below)

* **Workload-based identity**: Services/agets are identified based on what they are, not just what they possess or where the are deployed
* **Automatic certificate rotation**: Short-lived credentials (SPIFFE SVIDs) that expire automatically and rotated frequently
* **No secrets distribution**: SPIFFE implementations validate/attest workload identity before issuing credentials
* **Transport-level security**: Leverage mTLS ensures both parties authenticate each other (mutual auth)

SPIFFE/SPIRE can dramatically reduce security breaches caused by leaked passwords or API keys by using the actual identity of code that can be cryptographically verified. [Ambient Mesh](https://ambientmesh.io) is probably the easiest way to quickly implement SPIFFE in your workloads. 


### Dynamic, Runtime-Based IAM / Policy Enforcement

With workload identity in place, and the ability to "prove" identity, not just assume it based because api keys, we can build a robust access-management system based on identity, context, and policy:

* **User Identity federation**: Pass user identity context from enterprise SSO systems to all AI services
* **On Behalf Of**: Cryptographically tie together relationships between users and agents, based on policy
* **Agent identity attestation**: Require AI agents to have their own verifiable identity separate from user identity (ie, SPIFFE)
* **Centralized policy management**: Decouple access decisions from application code using policy engines like OPA, Cedar, Cerbos, etc
* **Context-aware authorization**: Make access decisions based on the combined context of user identity, agent identity, on-behalf-of, and call chain for resource being accessed, and request details
* **Real-time policy evaluation**: Enable dynamic updates to access policies without requiring code changes


## AI / LLM Gateways with Enhanced Security

API keys are often used because they are "easy" to get started. But just because something is easy doesn't mean you should take it to production. Identity and access management based on context and policy can be more involved to set up and implement, but [agent gateways](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-agentgateway-might-right-abstraction-john-willis-blnbe/?trackingId=2waH3WUBGddgRSGu%2Fo23AQ%3D%3D) can help manage / simplify things here: 

![](/images/api-keys/better.png)

* Validate identity tokens: Verify and validate SSO tokens from enterprise identity providers
* Enforce consistent policies: Apply uniform access controls across all AI systems, even reaching out to policy engines
* Implement advanced authentication: Support mTLS, token exchange, and other cryptographic methods
* Provide audit trails: Log all AI interactions with full identity context for compliance and security
* Handle token enrichment: Add additional claims and context for downstream services


## How to Secure Hosted LLM providers?

So far, we've mostly focused on securing communications and access within the enterprise and not using API keys to do so. But what about for calling external/provider hosted LLM services? Those services almost always use API keys to enable auth. In my opinion these providers take the "lowest common denominator" or "easiest for us" approach and leave the heavy lifting of making this approach secure TO YOU. 

The key here is to not let provider API keys proliferate in the enterprise. The fact that API keys need to be used must be shielded from enterprise users and isolated to a single place in the security architecture. The right approach is to have strong identity and access policy within the enterprise, and then use an AI/LLM gateway to shield callers to the upstream LLM calls. The AI gateway can mediate access and only if approved, inject/exchange the right upstream credentials to allow calls to proceed. The calling applications within the enterprise don't need to know anything about this. 

This gives the enterprise:

- **Single Point of Access**: All LLM requests flow through this gateway architecture
- **Internal Authentication**: Use your preferred authentication method (SPIFFE, JWT, mTLS, etc.) for internal services
- **API Key Isolation**: Only the gateway holds and uses the provider API keys
- **Enhanced Security Controls**: Add additional security layers like content filtering, prompt validation, and response screening
- **Unified Logging/Auditing**: Centralized visibility into all LLM usage

## Wrapping Up

The growing adoption of AI agents and LLMs within enterprises demands a fundamental shift in our approach to authentication and authorization. API keys‚Äîwith their static, coarse-grained nature and tendency to proliferate as "toxic data" create unacceptable security risks that are magnified by the probabilistic, autonomous behavior of AI systems.
By implementing a modern security approach based on cryptographic workload identity, dynamic policy enforcement, and enterprise managed AI gateways, enterprises can gain the fine-grained control they need while eliminating the vulnerabilities of API keys. This approach provides the foundation for secure AI adoption that meets regulatory requirements, prevents data leakage, and enables proper governance.

For public LLM providers that continue to rely on API keys, enterprises must contain this risk through proper gateway architectures that shield internal systems from these toxic credentials. This creates a clean separation between the enterprise's robust internal security model and the limitations imposed by external providers.
The [time to address these security fundamentals is now](https://blog.christianposta.com/ai-agents-are-not-like-microservices-or-monoliths/) before AI agents become more prevalent and before the next major breach exposes the inherent weaknesses of API keys. By embracing identity-first security based on "what you are" rather than "what you possess," enterprises can build AI systems that are both powerful and secure.
