<p>I'll be attending CamelOne this year, and I'm pretty excited. I didn't make it to the event last year, but judging by the speaker line up and the presentations given last year, this conference is definitely a must for developers involved in enterprise integration. Check out the <a href="http://fusesource.com/fuse/camelone-2011-videos/">presentations from last year</a>. As you can see, the content covered is applicable even if you're not using the <a href="http://fusesource.com/products/">Apache projects</a>. But of course if you are, all the better.</p>
<p>Of course attending a conference like this and hanging out with and listening to some of the leaders in open-source integration software like James, Strachan Claus Ibsen, Jon Anstey, Rob Davies, and many others, is awesome, there's another reason to attend. Being around people who are highly dedicated to the software craft and developing best-of-breed software really gets you excited and motivated. Seeing others excited and passionate about their projects is contagious. Looking at this year's conference, the <a href="http://fusesource.com/apache-camel-conference-2012/camelone_speakers_2012/">speaker list and sessions</a> here are the ones that appeal to me and I hope to get the most from:</p>
<h3>A Hundred Departments, Same Integration Solution</h3>
<p>Overview: How integration and SOA fit in a broad enterprise architecture; techniques for adding APIs to and integrating with legacy systems; design patterns for building new enterprise systems with integration in mind; techniques and code for business process management (BPM) using Camel &amp; ActiveMQ; and how the new paradigms are enabling us to work with external partners, lower the cost of software development, and offer new innovative services.</p>
<h3>Next Generation Open Source Messaging with Apollo</h3>
<p>Overview: Apache Apollo is built from the foundations of the Apache ActiveMQ project but with a radically different threading architecture which lets it scale to large number of concurrent connections and destinations while using a constant number of threads.</p>
<h3>Replacing MQSeries with ActiveMQ in Large Scale Retailer</h3>
<p>Overview: This session will discuss the development, deployment and lessons learned in a large scale retail implementation (1,000s of stores) where we are converting from IBM MQ Series to ActiveMQ and ServiceMix in a gradual manner</p>
<h3>Using Apache Camel in ServiceMix</h3>
<p>Overview: Jon Anstey (co-author Camel in Action) will show you the best practices for deploying Camel applications to ServiceMix. Since ServiceMix is built on top of Apache Karaf, most tips are applicable to that container as well.</p>
<h3>Apache Camel in Action: Common Problems, Solutions and Best Practices</h3>
<p>Overview: Advanced topics like transaction management in Camel (XA and non XA) and when you can live without it. This talk will give examples for how to start, stop, create, or modify Camel routes at runtime. It will also cover basic questions like “Java DSL vs. XML DSL”, “Exchange In-Message vs. Exchange Out-Message” or whether you should use one or multiple Camel contexts.</p>
<h3>Apache Camel at a Top 3 Online Retailer</h3>
<p>Overview: A Top 3 online retailer recently completed a live integration of their warehouse management and fulfillment systems with those of their parent company. The integration and cutover event was described as “open heart surgery on a moving train” by their CEO. This presentation will highlight how Apache Camel helped to make the integration possible, and how Camel is being leveraged at the online retailer today for a variety of integration solutions. Best practices, lessons learned, and insights based upon use cases from one of the world’s largest online retailers.</p>
