So you think you're going to do microservices? Did you also try to adopt SOA? And agile? And scrum?

>Update: links to the in-person preso and the webinar I did for these talks are here: <a href="https://t.co/SMhXojCVCM">In person @IteratePHX</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ck5bmdjj966ng9nnd6nv6ljptpo">Virtual JBUG webinar</a>

Business needs are getting more complex, demanding, and changing rapidly. You tried all the past hyped technologies and architectures but those promises have been under-delivering. Can microservices help here?

Believe it or not, technology isn't going to be the deciding factor. Adopting Spring Boot and fancy distributed config management or highly opinionated cloud infrastructure isn't going to get you to DevOps/Microservices/CloudNative/Insert-buzzword-here. But organizations _can_ be successful with these tools, so where are we missing?

So I'll touch on these things -- we'll dig deeper to figure out what are the bottlenecks so we can help organizations really achieve some of the unmet promises in the wake of technology hype -- including microservices.
