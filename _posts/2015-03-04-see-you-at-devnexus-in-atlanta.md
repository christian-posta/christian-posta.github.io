Next week I'll be giving a talk at the [DevNexus](https://www.devnexus.com/s/index) conference in Atlanta. AFAIK the event is sold out, so for those going, look forward to meeting you! 
 
The industry is buzzing with all kinds of hype these days, including #DevOps, #microservices, and #PaaS offerings (yay hashtags... you know it's hype when there's always hashtags before those words). Usually it's not until the hype settles that you actually start to see real-world problems solved with some of these approaches (and which ones fail). The difference is, since these new hyped movements sort of grew organically there is a little more legitimacy floating around them. But more importantly, OpenSource is driving this movement. I'm excited to be giving a talk on how some very popular opensource projects fit the paradigm of devops culture, microservices architectures, and tie together with PaaS. 

There are also a lot of other great talks scheduled! Lots of microservices, reactive, and IoT talks. Hope to see you there!
