Christian Posta (@christianposta) is a Chief Architect at Red Hat with 15+ years of experience building and designing highly scalable, resilient, distributed systems. He recently authored the book "Microservices for Java Developers" for O’Reilly and Red Hat (http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/microservices-for-java-developers.csp).

Christian has spent time at web-scale internet companies, as a specialist consultant in the integration and messaging space, as well as at traditional enterprises in the manufacturing, power-distribution, retail, and financial-services space. Christian now works closely with Red Hat’s strategic customers and partners to realize business value through technology by implementing cloud-native solutions using opensource including Red Hat’s extensive open-source portfolio. Christian guides customers covering topics such as high-performance messaging, integration, caching, stream processing, data-intensive architectures and how we deliver those in a cloud-native way with containers. He’s a committer in various open-source communities including Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, fabric8.io, and frequent contributor to the Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes communities and many others. He’s also on the project board/PMC of ActiveMQ.
