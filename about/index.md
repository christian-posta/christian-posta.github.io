My name is Christian, and I work for Red Hat as a Principal Solutions Architect in the Middleware Specialist group. I specialize in helping companies I work with use technology to make lots of money. I've worked with companies and technology groups in the shipping, banking, retail/e-retail, insurance, finance, healthcare, telecom, and government industries. I currently take on may roles: software architect, proficient developer, consultant, mentor, trainer, evangelist, speaker, and blogger. I'm passionate about software, teaching, doing things right, and keeping things simple.

## Focus
My focus is on building high-performing, scalable, available, fault-tolerant distributed systems using _Open Source_ technology. Creating these types of systems is a dark art, and I enjoy the challenge. Systems that I've worked on directly, architected, or guided, touch revenue streams of _billions_ of dollars in some of the most critical business paths for very household company names.  

## Open Source
I'm a firm believer in collaborative solutions, and believe working on technology _in the open_ is key to achieving the highest quality solutions. The more people involved, the more eyes on a solution, the better our solutions. I am a committer on a handful of opensource projects including [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org) (also on PMC), [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org), as well as contributor to projects like [fabric8.io](http://fabric8.io) and others that I come across that look interesting. 

## Speaker
I enjoy talking about the technology that I work with and the solutions that I work on. You can find me talking about the latest trends in 
cloud computing, microservices, integration, open-source, and design at the [Phoenix JUG](http://phxjug.org), [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/)/[DevNation](http://www.devnation.org), [DevNexus](http://www.devnexus.com/s/index) and others.
